### What? 
Fork of OkZoomer v4, updated to Minecraft 1.19, ported to Kotlin, moved to different (actually maintained) GUI and configuration libraries, and updated with some code from modern OkZoomer (LibZoomer).

This mod adds a zoom key (default `c`) that allows the user to zoom in their view, and is highly configurable.
If you don't like the default "feel" of the zoom, you can configure it to be however you want.

### Requirements
- Minecraft `1.20.2`
- [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/) `0.14.*` or the equivalent [Quilt](https://quiltmc.org/) version
- [ModMenu](https://github.com/TerraformersMC/ModMenu) `8.*` 
- [Fabric Language Kotlin](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-language-kotlin) `1.10.*` or the equivalent [QKL](https://modrinth.com/mod/qkl) version if using Quilt
- [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api) `0.89.*` or the equivalent [QFAPI](https://modrinth.com/mod/qsl) version if using Quilt
- [YACL](https://github.com/isXander/yetanotherconfiglib) `3.*`

Though not strictly required, ModMenu is the only way to access the configuration UI.

### Future Plans
- Scaling mouse sensitivity

Thanks to [Configurate](https://github.com/SpongePowered/Configurate), [SpruceUI](https://github.com/LambdAurora/SpruceUI), and [YACL](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib). Excellent libraries. 
Also [Devin's Badges](https://github.com/intergrav/devins-badges) are great.
### Quilt Statement
When I (trainb0y) started this project, a few mods I relied on didn't function on Quilt, so I decided to try to get some version of OkZoomer working on Fabric because the maintainer of OkZoomer had [decided to drop fabric support](https://gist.github.com/EnnuiL/79885a99e5c908010fa5eca527590b98).


This mod *does* work on Quilt, but you might as well use the original [OkZoomer](https://github.com/EnnuiL/OkZoomer).
