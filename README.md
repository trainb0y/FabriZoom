## What?

Fork of OkZoomer v4, updated to modern Minecraft, ported to Kotlin, moved to different (actually maintained) GUI and
configuration libraries, and updated with some code from modern OkZoomer (LibZoomer).

This mod adds a zoom key (default `c`) that allows the user to zoom in their view, and is highly configurable.
If you don't like the default "feel" of the zoom, you can configure it to be however you want.

# Forge?
Despite the name, this mod ***does*** support Forge, since version `2.0.0`. 
However, it is not as well tested and may have issues or bugs not present in the Fabric version, 
so be sure to report any issues you come across!

Thanks

and [YACL](https://github.com/isXander/YetAnotherConfigLib). Excellent libraries.
Also [Devin's Badges](https://github.com/intergrav/devins-badges) are great.

## Quilt Statement

When I (trainb0y) started this project, a few mods I relied on didn't function on Quilt, so I decided to try to get some
version of OkZoomer working on Fabric because the maintainer of OkZoomer
had [decided to drop fabric support](https://gist.github.com/EnnuiL/79885a99e5c908010fa5eca527590b98).

This mod *does* work on Quilt, but you might as well use the original [OkZoomer](https://github.com/EnnuiL/OkZoomer).
